        "**Comment**: not much difference in terms of topics was found in the results when choosing one Count vectorizer or another. However, the second model seemed to us better than the second for at least two reasons. First, we felt that in most cases the n-gram range set to (1, 3) provided us with better information (e.g., topic 27, 1st vs 2nd model: *ukip immigration policy* is more accurate than *ukip* & *immigration policy*; or, topic 49, in the 2nd model: *labour immigration pledge* highlighs where the pledge comes from). Second, the first model appeared to be exaggeratedly skewed towards the first topic (EU), probably because the model was not able to detect the different topics covered when talking about immigration within the EU context. Finally, at this stage of the optimization, the number of words defining a topic is set to 10. The results are quite satisfactory in terms of topic coherence but let's see what happens when incrementing this number. In fact, it is recommended to keep this value below 30 and preferably between 10 and 20, but never below 10."
